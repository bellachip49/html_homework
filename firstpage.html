<h1>Hello world.</h1> This is my first web page. There's more to come.

<hr>
<p>
I am learning how to use the horizontal rule, headline, paragraph and line break tags. Writing HTML isn't as hard as it appears.
</p>

<p>Here's a list of items I like about school:<br>
Science<br>
Reading<br>
But most of all--recess!<br>
</p>

<p>I can also create lists using numbers and bullets. Here is an example of a list with numbers:

<ol>
<li>My first item on the list.</li>
<li>My second item on the list.</li>
<li>My third item on the list.</li>
<li>My fourth item on the list.</li>
</ol>
